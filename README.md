Title: The Archetype: A Non-Perturbative Arithmetic Unification from the Even Unimodular Lorentzian Lattice II

Abstract: We present a non-perturbative theoretical framework, "The Archetype," which achieves arithmetic unification of fundamental constants through the even unimodular Lorentzian lattice II 
25,1
​
  and Monstrous Moonshine modular forms . Unlike traditional unification models that rely on free parameters or anthropic selection in a landscape, The Archetype derives physical observables directly from lattice invariants and j(τ) coefficients.




The framework is constructed upon a 26-node resonant Hamiltonian proven to be Hermitian and spectrally bounded, ensuring unitary time evolution and a stable vacuum ground state . By projecting the path integral measure onto the genus-zero subspace of the Monster module, we resolve the 10 
120
  discrepancy of the cosmological constant via modular regulation . We derive parameter-free values for the inverse fine-structure constant (α 
−1
 ≈137.036), the proton-to-electron mass ratio (≈1836.15), and the Higgs boson mass (m 
H
​
 ≈125.1 GeV) .





Furthermore, we address the continuum limit by demonstrating how smooth spacetime emerges from the discrete lattice via celestial holography and Mellin transforms . Ultraviolet completeness is established through a non-trivial renormalization group fixed point at g 
∗
 ≈0.85 . Testable predictions are provided for the 2026–2028 experimental window, including specific CMB power anomalies at l≈1800−2200 and a graviton mass bound below 10
